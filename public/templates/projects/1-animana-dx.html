          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Animana is a SaaS Veterinary Practice Management System. Its diagnostics ecosystem was fragmented and built upon an antiquated middleware system, causing 60% of customer support tickets. Diagnostic equipment suppliers were pressuring for integration access while clinics wanted multi-vendor flexibility. With each integration requiring custom development, creating a scalable system was impossible.</p>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>Transform fragmented diagnostic workflows into a scalable partner ecosystem that reduces technical debt and creates sustainable revenue growth, while improving the user experience for veterinarians.</p>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>Delivered a common diagnostics platform that eliminated major support friction and established the foundation for ecosystem expansion through a strategic partnership. Successfully launched with first partner with a second integration completed and additional partners in progress.</p>
