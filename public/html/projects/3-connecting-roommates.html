            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>The initial approach was focused on exploration. We ran face to face in-depth interviews with rent owners and living space seekers to learn more about their jobs to be done and how they solved them, understanding about pain points and opportunities in the process. We classified the journey into three main phases:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Looking for new roommates.</li>
              <li>Living (and getting along) with roommates.</li>
              <li>Managing expenses and chores with roommates.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Focusing on our first finding, we understood what our target users were having pains with: knowing who they would be compatible with, being able to trust the people they were talking to and not wanting to spend a lot of time finding a roommate.</p>

            <p>We found that people were mostly asking friends or using social media within their circles to solve their needs. We wanted to know if we could build an app that could expand their search without any concerns. We did a competitive analysis and benchmark, in order to see how other apps were solving these problems.</p>

            <p>We found that while there are alternatives, they are focused on apartment-hunting. These solutions are simple lists of rooms available. While that helps people find a place to live with a roommate, it does not aid them in finding a GOOD roommate.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>Having completed this research, we decided on core features to build a quick prototype and validate the idea. We wanted to answer the following questions:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Would our target users find the application useful to find good roommates?</li>
              <li>Would our target users trust the application enough to use it?</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="content-text">
            <p>We recruited 8 people to test the prototype and get enough insights to know whether the app would be worth pursuing or if we needed to pivot our idea.</p>

            <h2>Key learnings</h2>
            <h3>Don't get attached to ideas</h3>
            <p>This project had started as a Real Estate Listing website. While the initial idea had a lot of potential and was very interesting to the team, because of the current market and competition we decided to find a more niche solution. Understanding the context of the business, and surrounding ourselves with experts and mentors on the topic helped us make this decision.</p>
